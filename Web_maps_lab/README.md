# Filming locations
Python modules used to build a map which represents places
of filming films from IMDB database, represented by locations.list

## Usage
Run module ```Map_final.py``` and chose year and maximum ammount of 
locations to be displayed on the map. It will be saved in ```Films_map.html```
To view it simply open created ```html``` file.

## What can be seen
All locations are divided into three groups: ```busy```, with the green color, 
```casual``` with orange and ```lazy``` with red.
The location is ```busy``` if there were filmed more than 10 films that year,
```casual``` - more than five, ```lazy``` - less than six.

## Known issues
Some of the locations in ```loctions.list``` does not 
satisfy ```geopy``` requirements
Depending on the ammount of places to show, and your 
network speed, it may take a long time to load.

## Meaning and usage of tags in ```html``` file
  ```<DOCTYPE html>``` -
  ```<head>``` - container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag
  ```<meta>``` -
  ```<script>``` -
```<link>``` -
```<style>``` -
```<body>``` -
```<div>``` -
